# mk_properties
Django real-estate website. You can ask the broker to list their Real estate on the Website. So that customers can view the real estate at their convenience
Here I used the PostgreSQL database. To handle the data.
***
# Django backend Framework is used. 

User can ask the Broker listed on the website to list their property in exchange of some comission. 
And customer can make the enquiry for that property.
***
This website is made with the help of a course so that I can learn some complex backend stuff and I can create a website like this by my own.
